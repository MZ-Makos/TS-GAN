# TS-GAN
Implementation of conditional GAN in the predition of the transition state geometry based on the Cartesian coordinates of product and reactant. 

### Prerequisites:
* Python 3.8.0
* Tensorflow 2.2.0

### Prediction
TS-GAN was trained on three different data sets: A) hydrogen migration reactions, B) isomerizarion reaction, and C) transition metal catalyzed reaction.
